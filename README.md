## Office Management System

This project is an office management system split into two parts: the client side and the server side, along with shared components and configurations.

## Purpose
This system is designed to help manage office operations. It offers a structured framework with a frontend, backend, and shared modules, ready to be expanded with specific features such as attendance tracking, task management, employee administration, and more.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into several main folders:

* client – the frontend application (written in TypeScript and styled with Tailwind)
* server – the backend service
* shared – reusable modules or utilities used by both client and server
  There are also configuration and support files like the environment file (.env), project configuration files (TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite, PostCSS settings), and scripts like verify-db.js for database validation.

## Features and Technologies
The system offers a modular architecture:
• A client application built with TypeScript and modern tooling
• A server backend for handling logic, database interaction, and APIs
• Shared components to avoid duplication and maintain consistency
• Support files and tools for configuration, setup, and database health checks

## Getting Started (Suggested)
To start developing or using this system, you would typically:

1. Create a .env file and fill in environment-specific settings
2. Install dependencies in both client and server directories using your package manager (npm or yarn)
3. Adjust configuration files as needed (for TypeScript, Tailwind, build tools, etc.)
4. Start the server side to expose APIs or endpoints
5. Launch the client side to access the user interface
6. Optionally run database validation or setup scripts like verify-db.js

## Usage
Once running, the system can serve as a foundation to build:
• Employee management tools (profiles, departments, roles)
• Attendance tracking and reporting
• Task, project, or meeting management panels
• Dashboard interfaces using the frontend client
• Authentication and user roles via the server side

## Future Enhancements
You could expand this base system by adding:
• A user authentication flow (login, roles, permissions, signup)
• A database schema for employees, tasks, and office resources
• Frontend dashboards with charts and summaries
• REST API endpoints for CRUD operations
• Integrations like notifications, file uploads, or analytics
• Testing infrastructure for both client and server

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. You can clone the project, make changes in your own branch, test your improvements, and submit them back via pull requests—especially if you extend core functionality or refactor shared modules.
